## 🦠 Project 1: Modeling Infectious Disease Spread with SIR Models

**Course:** Math 542 — Mathematical Modeling  
**Tools:** Python, Mathematical Modeling, Least Squares  
**Topic:** COVID-19 SIR Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation  

### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the use of the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model to understand infectious disease spread. Using real-world COVID-19 data from Tennessee, I simulated infection rates during key time intervals and estimated parameters using Python.

### 📌 Table of Contents
- SIR Model Overview
- Mathematical Formulation
- Dynamics and Assuption of the model
- Extensions of the SIR Model (e.g. SIRS model)
- Case Study : Tenessee Covid 19

### Three Components
- Susceptible (S): Individuals who are not infected but are at risk of contracting the disease.​
- Infectious (I): Individuals who are currently infected and can transmit the disease to others.​
- Recovered (R): Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to have gained immunity.​

Also notice the flow of the three components in the SIR model.
Susceptible -> Infected -> Recovered​

### Mathematical Formulation 
- β(beta): Transmission rate, representing the likelihood of disease transmission from an infected to a susceptible individual.​
- (γ)(gamma): Recovery rate, indicating the rate at which infected individuals recover and move to the recovered compartment.

## 🌍 Project 2: Principal Component Analysis of Global CO₂ Emissions

**Course:** Stat 520 — Multivariate Statistics  
**Tools:** PCA, Correlation Matrix, Eigenvalue Analysis  
**Topic:** Identifying Major Global Contributors to CO₂ Emissions  

### 🔍 Overview
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze CO₂ emissions data from 1990 to 2021. The goal was to identify dominant trends and major contributors to global pollution using data from the EDGAR database.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA
- Interpretation of eigenvalues and loading vectors
- Emissions trend comparison across major economies
- Environmental policy implications

### 📊 Findings
- The **first two principal components explain ~99%** of the variation.
- **Prin1** captured total emissions; **Prin2** revealed rising emissions in countries like China and India.
- China surpassed the U.S. in emissions by over 50% in recent years.
- The analysis reflects economic trends and raises questions about environmental responsibility.
