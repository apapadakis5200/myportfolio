# Alexis Papadakis â€” Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository highlights selected academic projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, mathematical modeling, and programming. These projects were completed as part of my coursework in mathematics, statistics, and data science.

## ðŸ“Š Project 1: Modeling Infectious Disease Spread Using the SIR Model

**Course:** Math 542  
**Instructor:** Professor Shen  
**Language/Tools:** Python, Mathematical Modeling, Least Squares Method  
**Dataset:** COVID-19 data from the Tennessee Department of Health

### ðŸ”¬ Overview
This project explores the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model as a tool for understanding infectious disease dynamics. The basic and extended forms of the SIR model were analyzed, with a focus on real-world application to COVID-19 data.

### ðŸ§® Key Concepts
- Formulation of discrete and continuous differential equations.
- Analysis of the reproduction number \( R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} \) and its implications.
- Implementation of parameter estimation via least squares to find Î² (transmission rate) and Î³ (recovery rate).
- Simulation of the SIR model over three key intervals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### ðŸ“ˆ Methods & Analysis
- Differential equation modeling
- Matrix linearization around equilibrium points
- Custom Python scripts to simulate infection dynamics
- Visualization of predicted vs. real infection rates

### ðŸ“· Sample Outputs
Plots and computed matrices show changes in infection rates across three key time intervals:
- **March 12â€“25, 2020**
- **November 2â€“15, 2020**
- **December 18â€“31, 2021**
