## 🦠 Project 1: Modeling Infectious Disease Spread with SIR Models

**Course:** Math 542 — Mathematical Modeling  
**Tools:** Python, Mathematical Modeling, Least Squares  
**Topic:** COVID-19 SIR Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation  

### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the use of the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model to understand infectious disease spread. Using real-world COVID-19 data from Tennessee, I simulated infection rates during key time intervals and estimated parameters using Python.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- Discrete and continuous SIR model derivations
- Estimation of transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (γ)
- Simulation and visualization of infection dynamics
- Linearization around equilibrium points

### 🧪 Case Study Intervals
- March 12–25, 2020
- November 2–15, 2020
- December 18–31, 2021

### 📈 Results
Python was used to simulate the SIR model over time and visualize infection curves. Key parameters were estimated using the method of least squares, and matrix analysis provided insight into system stability.

## 🌍 Project 2: Principal Component Analysis of Global CO₂ Emissions

**Course:** Stat 520 — Multivariate Statistics  
**Tools:** PCA, Correlation Matrix, Eigenvalue Analysis  
**Topic:** Identifying Major Global Contributors to CO₂ Emissions  

### 🔍 Overview
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze CO₂ emissions data from 1990 to 2021. The goal was to identify dominant trends and major contributors to global pollution using data from the EDGAR database.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA
- Interpretation of eigenvalues and loading vectors
- Emissions trend comparison across major economies
- Environmental policy implications

### 📊 Findings
- The **first two principal components explain ~99%** of the variation.
- **Prin1** captured total emissions; **Prin2** revealed rising emissions in countries like China and India.
- China surpassed the U.S. in emissions by over 50% in recent years.
- The analysis reflects economic trends and raises questions about environmental responsibility.

### 🌱 Final Thoughts
This project highlighted the correlation between economic development and environmental degradation. It also opened up discussions about the ethical and financial responsibilities of nations with the highest carbon footprints.
