## 🦠 Project 1: Modeling Infectious Disease Spread with SIR Models

**Course:** Math 542 — Mathematical Modeling  
**Tools:** Python, Mathematical Modeling, Least Squares  
**Topic:** COVID-19 SIR Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation  

### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the use of the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model to understand infectious disease spread. Using real-world COVID-19 data from Tennessee, I simulated infection rates during key time intervals and estimated parameters using Python.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- Discrete and continuous SIR model derivations
- Estimation of transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (γ)
- Simulation and visualization of infection dynamics
- Linearization around equilibrium points

### 🧪 Case Study Intervals
- March 12–25, 2020
- November 2–15, 2020
- December 18–31, 2021

## 🌍 Project 2: Principal Component Analysis of Global CO₂ Emissions

**Course:** Stat 520 — Multivariate Statistics  
**Tools:** PCA, Correlation Matrix, Eigenvalue Analysis  
**Topic:** Identifying Major Global Contributors to CO₂ Emissions  

### 🔍 Overview
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze CO₂ emissions data from 1990 to 2021. The goal was to identify dominant trends and major contributors to global pollution using data from the EDGAR database.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA
- Interpretation of eigenvalues and loading vectors
- Emissions trend comparison across major economies
- Environmental policy implications

### 📊 Findings
- The **first two principal components explain ~99%** of the variation.
- **Prin1** captured total emissions; **Prin2** revealed rising emissions in countries like China and India.
- China surpassed the U.S. in emissions by over 50% in recent years.
- The analysis reflects economic trends and raises questions about environmental responsibility.
